          I'm Not Lazy, It's Called a Capsule Wardrobe and it's Classy

        <h3>A Closet Full of Nothing to Wear</h3>
        <p>
          During my years working at Nordstrom, I accumulated quite the
          collection of clothing. Between giveaways, contest prizes, and the
          allure of my employee discount, I was coming home with a shopping bag
          almost daily at one point, and by the time I left my career there, my
          closet was bursting at the seams. Despite, or maybe because of this,
          the vast majority of the time when I opened my closet door to get
          dressed for the day, I almost always had nothing to wear. Usually
          after hours of searching, I would usually settle for one of a few
          outfits that I felt comfortable and confident in and tended to default
          to. If I had to estimate, I only wore about 30% of my pieces on a
          regular basis, while the vast majority of my closet sat untouched.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I left fashion retail and had access to neither the employee
          discount nor the daily temptation of in-store marketing, my shopping
          habits changed quite a bit. I still had my massive closet, and still
          cycled through the same dozen or so outfits I felt most comfortable
          in. Then, one day while browsing Pinterest, I came across the concept
          of a capsule wardrobe.
        </p>
        <h3>Introducing: The Capsule Wardrobe</h3>
        <figure class="inner-image">
          <img
            src="../IMG/wardrobe-capsule.jpeg"
            alt="A Basic Wardrobe Capsule"
            class="inner-image"
          />
          <figcaption class="inner-image-caption">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          According to
          <a
            href="https://www.sustainably-chic.com/blog/what-is-a-capsule-wardrobe"
            >Sustainably Chic</a
          >, “A capsule wardrobe is a limited selection of interchangeable
          clothing pieces that complement each other.” They usually are composed
          of about 30 basic pieces, including a two or three tanks tops, tee
          shirts, blouses, skirts, jeans, slacks, and dresses along with one or
          two sweaters, jackets, a few pairs of shoes and several accessories to
          tie it all together. The purpose of a capsule wardrobe is to make it
          easier to get dressed in the morning since you only have a limited
          selection of curated pieces that all coordinate with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I discovered the capsule wardrobe, I basically had my work cut
          out for me. I already had most of my capsule collected, it was just a
          matter of cutting out the excess. Over the course of the next few
          weeks, I trimmed the fat of my closet, donating almost three full bags
          of clothes to goodwill and even selling a few pieces on eBay. At first
          I kept two capsules, one for the colder fall and winter months, and
          another for spring and summer. Since moving to Florida however, I only
          use the one, though I do keep my winter capsule on hand for the few
          days of the year when it does get a little chilly. Ultimately I'm
          grateful for the wardrobe capsule, as it allows me to do what I was
          doing anyway without the stress of having a closet full of nothing to
          wear. And more importantly, my bank account is also much happier!
