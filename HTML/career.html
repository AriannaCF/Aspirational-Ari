        <h3>Some Background</h3>
        <p>In the spring of 2021, after three arduous years of selling new and used Toyotas, I decided it was time for a career shift. With the COVID pandemic still in full swing, and the supply chain crisis looming on the horizon, I, along with many of my coworkers, jumped ship from the car business, and into the waters of insurance sales. I figured a cushy, WFH job was something I had earned after years of slogging through retail hell, and I was excited to start my new career as a Licensed Insurance Agent. The hours were much better - 40 hours per week as opposed to the 65+ that I was expected to put in at the car dealership, and once I pushed through the initial pressures of studying for and passing my state exams, I figured that the job would be very straightforward and simple.
        </p>
        
        <div class="blockquote-container">
        <blockquote>Those were some awful years and there was definitely some illegal stuff going on, but surely this is much worse.</blockquote>
        <cite>Me when Trump was President</cite>
        </div>

        <p>Fast forward one year later and I was miserable. Insurance sales, while indeed simple enough to do, is <u>incredibly, mind numbingly boring</u>. You ask the same customers the same questions following the same script over and over again day in and day out. There's no excitement, very little problem solving, and zero creativity. Things got so bad that I started reminiscing about my old job like I reminisced about the Bush era during the Trump administration: <q>Those were some awful years and there was definitely some illegal stuff going on, but surely this is much worse.</q> </p>
        <p>Eventually I decided it was time to go back to the drawing board and make yet another career pivot. This time, I was determined to pick a career that both satisfies my need for mental stimulation and also has a high earning potential. After weighing my options, I decided it was time to do what I had been advised to by many an online career coach, and learn to code.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>But where to start? My first stop was the same resource I always consult when I want to learn something new: YouTube. I really cannot underestimate how much YouTube has helped me throughout my life. I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you that literally about half of the things I know about being an adult, I learned on YouTube. From beauty tips to financial advise and more, YouTube has been so clutch on so many occasions. For this particular deep dive, I took my time to search specifically for young black women with or without CS degrees who were working as developers. I found a few and began working my way through their content. Only about an hour later, I knew what the beginning of my learning journey would look like:
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>start with html</li>
            <li>follow up with css</li>
            <li>learn javascript</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Once I had these three skills, I would be well on my way to becoming a professional Front-End Web developer. I should also mention that the <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/c/nicoleyoungtech” target="_blank">Nicole.Young</a> channel is where I found the application for the OneTen Scholarship Program, which allowed me to enroll in the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011" target="_blank">Frontend Web Development Fundamentals Nanodegree Program</a> through Udacity, which I absolutely would not have been able to afford without the scholarship. This program has been a godsend for me. I really don't know if I would have been able to get this far without it. Having learning goals with deadlines and a team of instructors and fellow learners to hold me accountable is the main thing keeping me motivated to keep learning, and I'm so thankful that I was able to find the program!</p>
        <p>There are several other resources that I've also learned a lot from. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> has an Intro to Web Development course specialization offered by the University of Michigan that I've been auditing for free. Udemy has an awesome <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target="_blank">WebDev bootcamp</a> taught by Colt Steele that I was able to snag on sale for $24, which has been worth every penny. 
        </p>
        <h3>Ari has an Aptitude for WebDev</h3>
        <p>Once I got started learning to code, I was almost angry at myself for not starting sooner. I almost immediately got the feeling that I'm perfectly suited for this line of work, and that the signs were there all along.</p>
        <p>During my brief stint working as a Keyholder for a Pandora jewelry franchise when I first arrived in the state of Florida, one of my responsibilities became to create sales trackers for store contests on google docs. It wasn't my job at first, but when I made one for fun on one of my days off and showed it to my manager, she was so impressed that decided to allow me to make them on the clock during my shifts whenever we had a new contest. 
        </p>
        <p>My next job after that was the Toyota dealership. The sales tracker that every salesperson was required to hand in to get credit for their deals at the end of the month was a poorly formatted, thrice photocopied excel sheet that was expected to be xfilled out by hand. One of the first things I did when I started there was create a new one in excel that automatically added up each deal, and calculated the expected paycheck including spiffs and bonuses. I added conditional formatting that would turn certain cells from red to green once the minimum threshold for bonuses was reached, and assigned different colors to new vs used cars. I initially made it just for myself, but one day, after we ran out of the photocopies of the old sales tracker, I shared my version with a few team members, who immediately shared it with the rest of the team. By the following month, all 45 members of the sales department were using my tracker.
        </p>
        <p>I could go on, but those are just a few examples of how I was programming well before I learned any actual code. I've always enjoyed working in excel making spreadsheets and automating processes, and I never thought to expand my knowledge by learning to code until very recently. I've been kicking myself because it seems so obvious, but better late than never I guess. 
        </p>
        <p>I'm super excited to be on this journey and have really enjoyed the learning process so far. I'm very much looking forward to making this my career, and have never been more excited about the future. Finally learning to code has been one of the best decisions I have ever made, and I'm so happy to have found my calling!</p>
