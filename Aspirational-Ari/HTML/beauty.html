          No Makeup Makeup - How to Catfish With Your Makeup Routine

        <h3>My Humble Beginnings</h3>
        <p>
          I'll never forget the day I discovered the transformational power of
          makeup. I was a sophomore in high school, sitting at a table in the
          cafeteria with my friends during free period talking about whatever
          teenage girls talked about in 2006. One of my friends was sitting
          right across from me, putting on her makeup while we chatted, and I
          got to watch the process from start to finish. It was a very simple
          routine, just some light powder and blush, eyeliner and a touch of
          mascara. She was only about 16 years old, so she didn't need any of it
          of course, but the before and after was striking.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a little bit before the era of instagram and then endless sea
          of YouTube tutorials we have now, so up to that point I had only ever
          watched my mom's makeup routine, and had never seen a similar
          transformation on a girl my own age. The most makeup I had ever worn
          up to that point was for a halloween costume when I was maybe seven or
          eight years old, for which my mom diligently and expertly recreated
          1920's style flapper girl makeup look, complete with Betty Boop
          lipstick and razor thin brows. Outside of costume makeup and some
          neutral lipstick on special occasions, I hadn't really worn much
          makeup, and had never applied it myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          That same day after school, I stopped my the Walmart on my way home to
          pick up some supplies. The first makeup I ever bought was black
          eyeliner, mascara, and pink lip gloss. I went home and started
          practicing immediately. My first attempt looked <em>insane</em>, I
          want way to heavy on the eyeliner and it was super uneven. After about
          three times of washing it off and reapplying, I finally figured out
          the perfect amount to apply. A simple thin line right on the lower
          eyeliner and mascara on the upper lid to balance it out was the best I
          could do. From then on that was my daily makeup routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later my mom taught me about powder foundation, and gave the one of
          her Maybelline eyebrow pencils to fill in my brows, a product that I
          still use to this day over 15 years later. While I've varied my makeup
          routine through the years, my go to daily look in recent years has
          been a much more natural look that omits eyeliner altogether and
          relies mostly on good skincare and bone structure.
        </p>
        <h3>The No Makeup Makeup Routine</h3>
        <p>
          It's exactly what it sounds like. The goal is to do your makeup in
          such a way that it looks like you're not wearing any makeup at all.
          I'm not even going to front, the ultimate goal is to deceive. I want
          to be able to loudly proclaim <b>“I Woke Up Like This”</b> while lying
          through my teeth and not being questioned at all. I have two main
          methods of pulling off this proverbial slight of hand. The first was
          taught to me my the one and only Jackie Aina.
        </p>
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wcxzcwNUP8E"
          title="YouTube video player"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          The second method is a bit more heavy handed, and meant for times when
          I want to look casual and effortlessly gorgeous without needing to
          necessarily trick anyone into thinking I have a bare face. Those
          uninitiated to makeup (and pretty much all men, let's be real) can
          probably be fooled into thinking that this is my natural face, while
          anyone who wears makeup will most likely not be fooled. This
          particular method was taught to me by the lovely Tea Renee.
        </p>
        <iframe
          width="560"
          height="315"
          src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nI-kCccz6Yo"
          title="YouTube video player"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <p>
          And that's it! That's how I trick people into thinking that I look way
          better than I actually do. At times do I feel guilty for using the
          tools of the feminine trade to deceive the masses? Sure, but then I
          just remember all of the men out there who are concealing their weak
          chins and nonexistent jawlines with full, luscious beards, and I
          immediately feel vindicated.
